            "description": "The port defines the type of connection between the PC and the dVRK controllers. For anyone using FireWire for all the connections, the setting should be `fw`. If your system uses FireWire between the dVRK controller and Ethernet to bridge between the controllers and the PC, use `udpfw`. Finally, if your system is recent (post 2024) and only uses FPGA V3, you can connect everything using Ethernet cables and use `udp`.\nIf you have multiple FireWire or Ethernet adapters on your PC, you will need to add the FireWire port number or Ethernet IP address after the port's type (e.g. `fw:1`).\nHaving multiple IOs is very convenient to handle systems with multiple surgeon's consoles. For example, one might want a system with 2 MTMLs and 2 MTMRs. The issue is that each arm assumes a default board Id based on the arm's type. Therefore, both MTMLs would use the same board Id(s) and create a conflict if used on the same IO port.\nAccepted values are `fw`, `fw:X` (`X` is FireWire port), `udpfw`, `udp` or `udp:xx.xx.xx.xx` (`xx.xx.xx.xx` is the IP address of the dVRK controller.  Default controller address is 169.254.0.100.  Values are parsed by `BasePort::ParseOptions` in library Amp1394.",

This is the only protocol supported on older firmware (3 and below).\n - `sequential-read-broadcast-write`: the PC reads sequentially but performs a single write for all the boards. The write message is an array of values sent to the boards, each board access the data it needs by index (N reads, 1 write). This is the default protocol for the dVRK controllers with firmware 4 and above.\n - `broadcast-query-read-write`: the PC sends a single query/synchronization to all boards, read values are aggregated in single packet over the bus and there's a single write (1 query, 1 read, 1 write). This is the fastest protocol available but some FireWire cards seem to have trouble synchronizing the read packets.
