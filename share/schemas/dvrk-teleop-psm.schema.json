In any of these motions exceed the corresponding thresholds, the tele-operation component assumes the operator have their hand on the MTM and tele-operation can start.  If any of these threshold is set to zero, the tele-operation will start without any motion the on the MTM.

This can also be useful for alternate MTMs (e.g. ForceDimension devices) with a smaller SO3 space which might require orientation \"clutching\".

By default, the tele-operation component assumes that the MTM gripper maximum angle is 60 degrees (as defined in the [gripper calibration](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/Calibration)) and the angle 0 corresponds to the PSM jaws being closed.  When closed (angle set to 0), the PSM jaws don't apply any significant torque (just enough for the PID control to maintain a zero angle) so to apply a stonger grip, the tele-operation component sends a negative jaw angle to the PSM.  Since the jaws can't have a negative angle, this will lead to a higher tracking error and by direct consequence, the PID will apply a strong torque.  The \"gripper-scaling\" parameters are used to linearly interpolate the MTM gripper angles to the default convention, i.e. [0, 60] for positive range and some room for negative angles.<br>For example, if your MTM has an effective range of [0, 30], set the \"max\" to 30 and the \"zero\" to 5.  This way the values between 5 and 30 will be mapped to [0, 60] and values below 5 will generate negative angles for the PSM jaws (i.e. applying extra torque)",
